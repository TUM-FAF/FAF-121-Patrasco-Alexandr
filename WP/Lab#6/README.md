##About

![The App](http://i.imgur.com/i2vjwTq.png)

 I created a starship bridge, that would have basic functionality, i.e. Weapon control, Shields, Locking on target, Hyperjump and Cloaking.

Progress bars use timer to charge.
When the button "Add SWAG!" is pressed it plays a sound.
Fire button resets chargers of Weapons.
There's also .gif imagery implemented, for this I had to use external dependeny(WpfAnimatedGif), since by default WPF does not provide programmer with the possibility of using .gif.
