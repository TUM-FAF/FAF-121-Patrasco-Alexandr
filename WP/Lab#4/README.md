Mandatory Objectives
* Create an animation based on Windows timer which involves at least 5 different drawn objects

Objectives With Points
* Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel **(2 pt)**
* Solve flicking problem **(2 pt)** _please describe in your readme/report how you did it_
* Add animated objects which interact with each other **(2-6 pt)**, ex.:
  * Few balls which have different velocity and moving angles. In order to get max points, add balls with mouse, make balls to change color on interaction and any other things that will show your engineering spirit
  * Any other interesting and reach in animation application

In this application the balls are created by clicking on the screen and assigned a color, unfortunately I didn't implement inter ball colision, but when the border impact occures balls change color and direction. Mouse wheel can be used to adjust animation speed.
