##Objectives accomplished

Mandatory Objectives
* Draw few lines of different colors and weights

* Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
* Draw 2 different objects using mouse

Objectives With Points

* Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects **(2 pt)**
* Draw a Bezier curve using mouse **(1 pt)**
* Fill an object with a gradient **(1 pt)**
* Use mouse as an eraser of:
  * a fixed width **(1 pt)**
  * a adjustable width **(2 pt)**

##About

In this app is incorporated functionality to draw several types of figures, such as: ellipses, polygons, Bezier curves(have to dra two straight lines to build), lines, curves.
This app also outputs a custom Bitmap image and a gradient field. I ordered the tools in toolboxes and option boxes. In order to change color user has to input the decimal value of intencity for each of RGB channels.
